Factorial folder has solutions for factorial in c and ruby

As the factorial for large numbers cannot be stored in primitive data types in C, an array is used with MAX_DIGITS as 1000. Under this assumption, the maximum number of digits possible in the factorial are 1000. If the factorial is large, the number can be changed by changing the value of MAX_DIGITS variable.

To run the program in C, run the following commands:

```bash
$ gcc factorial.c
$ ./a.out positive_number
```

To run the program in ruby, run the following command:

```bash
$ ruby factorial.rb postive_number
```
